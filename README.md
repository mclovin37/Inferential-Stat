### Introduction to the Data
From "Data Analysis Project Information":

Your project will consist of 4 parts:

Data: (3 points) Describe how the observations in the sample are collected, and the implications of this data collection method on the scope of inference (generalizability / causality). Note that you might will need to look into documentation on the GSS to answer this question. See http://gss.norc.org/ as well as the "More information on the data" section below.
Research question: (3 points) Come up with a research question that you want to answer using these data. You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for. You are welcomed to create new variables based on existing ones. Along with your research question include a brief discussion (1-2 sentences) as to why this question is of interest to you and/or your audience.
EDA: (10 points) Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) that addresses the research question you outlined above. Your EDA should contain numerical summaries and visualizations. Each R output and plot should be accompanied by a brief interpretation.
Inference: (28 points) Perform inference that addresses the research question you outlined above. Each R output and plot should be accompanied by a brief interpretation.

#### Data source

This extract of the General Social Survey (GSS) Cumulative File 1972-2012 provides a sample of selected indicators in the GSS with the goal of providing a convenient data resource for students learning statistical reasoning using the R language. Unlike the full General Social Survey Cumulative File, we have removed missing values from the responses and created factor variables when appropriate to facilitate analysis using R. Our hope is that this will allow students to focus on statistical concepts without having to (initially) be concerned about some of the data management and interpretation issues associated with missing data and factor variables in R. Other than the two modifications mentioned above, all data and coding come from the original dataset. Students and researchers seeking to conduct research or explore the full codebook behind the full General Social Survey Cumulative File are urged to consult the original dataset at the citation that follows:

### The Scripts
This project feautures a RMarkdown document produced in RStudio and knitted to HTML. Please view the .html, .Rmd, or .md file for an overview of both the assignment questions and my responses.
